Arithmetic operators
===================================================

*  => multiplication
/  => division
-  => subtraction

Above perators are available for Integers, floating points and complex numbers

%  => remainder - Integers

+  => Addition - integer, floating points, complex numbers, and strings (concatenation)

/*
Decrement and increment operators

-> Go supports the ++ (increment) and the
Increment and decrement operators are statements not expressions
Increment and decrement statements only support the postfix notation.
Not available --i or ++i NOT SUPPORTED // Syntaax error

/*
Go assignment operators
====================================================
 =  => Assignment. it updates the left operand with the value of the right.

 := => Colon equal operator declares a new variable, the left side operator,
 and assigns it the value (and type) of the operand on the right.

 +=, -=, *=, /=, %= Apply the indicated operation using the left and the right operator and store the result in the left operator.const

 for instance a*= 8 implies a=a*8

*/

/*
Bitwise operators
======================================================
&  = Bitwise AND
|  = Bitwise OR
a^b = Bitwise XOR
&^ = Bitwise AND NOT
<< = Left-shift
>> = Right-shift

Logical Operators
=======================================================

The following is a list of Go logical operations on Boolean Values

&& = Logical AND
|| = Logical OR
!  = Logical NOT

Comparison Operators
========================================================
==  equal      String, numeric, Boolean, interface, pointer and struct types
!=  Not Equal  String, numeric, Boolean, interface, pointer and struct types
<, <=, >, >= Ordering operators  String, integers and floating point
